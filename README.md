The following files are portions of the final exam I submitted to Udacity for the Programming Languages course.
The coursework was heavily focused on parsing, lexing, finite and non-finite state machines, as well as using regular
expressions for both searching and defining tokens for both parsing and lexing.

This documents all of the answers I submitted and the way I went about solving them.
